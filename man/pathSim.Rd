\title{Compare pathways}
\usage{
pathSim(g1, g2)
}
\arguments{
\item{g1, g2}{Graph in GraphNEL format, or a character list with the names of
the proteins in each pathway.}
}
\value{
A score between 0 and 1 calculated as the doble of the proteins
shared by g1 and g2 divided by the number of genes in both groups.
}
\description{
Function to estimate how much two graphs or list of genes overlap by looking
how much of the nodes are shared.
