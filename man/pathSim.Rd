\title{Calculates the Dice similarity between pathways}
\usage{
pathSim(pathway1, pathway2, info)

mpathSim(pathways, info, method = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway1, pathway2}{A single pathway to calculate the similarity}

\item{info}{A list of genes and the pathways they are involved.}

\item{pathways}{Pathways to calculate the similarity for}

\item{method}{To combine the scores of each pathway, one of \code{c("avg",
"max", "rcmax", "rcmax.avg", "BMA")}, if NULL returns the matrix of
similarities.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link{combineScores}}}
}
\value{
The similarity between those pathways or all the similarities
between each comparison.
}
\description{
Calculates the similarity between pathways using dice similarity score.
}
\details{
\code{diceSim} is used to calculate similarities between the two pathways.

\code{mpathSim} compares the similarity between several pathways and can use
\code{\link{combineScores}} to extract the similarity between those
pathways.
If one needs the matrix of similarities between pathways set the argument
methods to \code{NULL}.
}
\note{
pathways accept named characters, and then the output will have
the names
}
\examples{
library("reactome.db")
# Extracts the paths of all genes of org.Hs.eg.db from reactome
genes.react <- as.list(reactomeEXTID2PATHID)
(paths <- sample(unique(unlist(genes.react)), 2))
pathSim(paths[1], paths[2], genes.react)

(paths <- sample(unique(unlist(genes.react)), 10))
mpathSim(pathways, genes.react, NULL)
named_paths <- structure(c("R-HSA-112310", "R-HSA-112316", "R-HSA-112315"),
.Names = c("Neurotransmitter Release Cycle",
"Neuronal System", "Transmission across Chemical Synapses"))
mpathSim(named_paths, genes.react, NULL)
