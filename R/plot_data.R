# Function to make it easier to plot the data:

# Pick up the edges to show
# 1: From a similarity matrix calculate the density of the edges.
# 2: From there calculate the ecdf to pick the top x% (parameter)
# 3: Transform it into a data.frame

# Pick the distribution of the points
# 1: calculate the dissimlarity
# 2: calculate the PCA of the first 2 dimensions


# Plot the entities and its edges


# Function to plot the data with ggplot2 if installed.
