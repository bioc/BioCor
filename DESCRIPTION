Description:
    The functional similarity, based on the pathways described on KEGG and 
    REACTOME, of genes provide quantitative ways to measure similarities 
    between genes. This similarities can be combined with co-expression 
    similarity or semantic similarities to improve network building, gene 
    selection, functionality testing...
