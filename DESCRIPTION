Description: Calculates functional similarities based on the pathways
        described on KEGG and REACTOME or in gene sets. These
        similarities can be calculated for pathways or gene sets,
        genes, or clusters and combined with other similarities. They
        can be used to improve networks, gene selection, testing
        relationships...
