Description: Calculates functional similarities based on the
    pathways described on KEGG and REACTOME or in gene sets. These
    similarities can be calculated for pathways or gene sets, genes, or
    clusters and combined with other similarities. They can be used to
    improve networks, gene selection, testing relationships...
