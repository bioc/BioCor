Description:
    Calculates similarities based on the pathways described on KEGG and 
    REACTOME. This similarities can be calculated for genes, pathways or 
    clusters and combined with co-expression similarities or semantic 
    similarities to improve network building, gene selection, 
    functionality testing...
