Description: Calculates functional similarities based on the pathways
    described on KEGG and REACTOME or in gene sets. These similarities can
    be calculated for pathways or gene sets, genes, or clusters and
    combined with other similarities. They can be used to improve
    networks, gene selection, testing relationships...
