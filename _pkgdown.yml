  title: Calculate functional similarities between genes
  description: Calculates functional similarities based on the
    pathways or gene sets. These similarities can be calculated for pathways or
    gene sets, genes, or clusters and combined with other similarities. They
    can be used to improve networks, gene selection, testing relationships...
